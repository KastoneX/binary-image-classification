In the 15frames file we pull every 15th frame from the video sequence. 
Then we manually or with the help of yolov5 divide all frames into different folders. 
The first folder is the person sitting at the table. The second folder - no one is at the table.

Machine learning. I used pre-trained models, ResNet18 and InceptionV3. Worked with both TensorFlow and PyTorch.
